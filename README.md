# Title of Project: Covid Analysis for Code Clause
 
# Description:
In this project I had done many operations and functions by which it can be easily and convinently for others to learn about covid rates on the basis of recent. I had used one Data Set from Kaggle.com which available publically you can download or use it from below mentioned link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/corona-virus-report 

# About Dataset:
1. A new coronavirus designated 2019-nCoV was first identified in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province

5. As of 30 January 2020, approximately 8,243 cases have been confirmed

# Installation:

1. Step 1: Download the code 
2. Steo 2: Install the Libraries pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib.
